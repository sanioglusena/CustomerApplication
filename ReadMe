Customer Application

Technology Stack:
- Springboot
- H2 in memory database
- Caffeine for cache
- Swagger for documentation


General Notes:
I used H2 database so that application can be run without configuration changes.
There is a class named ControllerExceptionHandlerAdvice to handle exceptions and return valid information to clients. In this class errors were logged as well.
Request, response values and request time measures can be seen from Swagger documentation.
"Get customers by city" request's response is cached; and cache is evicted when there is a customer or address change.
SQL queries were used for search. I could use Elastic search for these methods; but I wanted to keep application simple and easy to run without configuration changes.
Unit and integration tests can be found under test folder.
